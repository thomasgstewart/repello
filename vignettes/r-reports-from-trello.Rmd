# Overview
The goal of the Repello package is to obtain information from a Trello board and
view the contents in a more user-friendly fashion.  This package will allow a
user to store the information from Trello cards, including card checklists and 
date of last modification.  The package also allows two saved Trello objects to
be compared to check for changes to the status and items of card checklist tasks.

# Installation
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("repello")
```

# Getting Started

## Loading supplementary packages
```{r, warning=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(require(repello))
#Note: you may want to also install the following packages for well-formatted report tables
suppressPackageStartupMessages(require(knitr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(require(kableExtra))
```

## Setting the user token
Using this package requires you to have your own Trello account.  This package
obtains information from Trello boards using API calls.  To access Trello
information, you first need to obtain your unique user token.  Access to a user
token can be found by logging into Trello and visiting `https://trello.com/app-key`,
then by clicking on "Manually generate a token".  Once you have generated your 
token, save it into a text file somewhere on your computer.  Be sure to set your
working directory to the  file location before you attempt to run the code.

Setting the user token is a critical first step for using this package.  Always
be sure to set the token prior to using any of the other functions in this
package

```{r}
set_token("user_token.txt")
```

# Viewing information for a specified Trello board

All you need to get started with the Repello package is the name of the board
you want to view.  This example will use the board 
"Repello - R Reports from Trello".  You can access this board on Trello for
reference at https://trello.com/b/CMNHqjea/repello-r-reports-from-trello.

The cards_info function allows you to view the card information from a board.

```{r}
activity <- cards_info(get_board_id("Repello - R Reports from Trello"))
head(activity) %>% kable(escape=F, align="cl") %>% trimws %>% kable_styling(c("striped","bordered"))
```

## Checklists

The all_checklists function can be used to view all card information and
accompanying checklists in a list format.

```{r}
trello_object <- all_checklists("Repello - R Reports from Trello", save=FALSE)
#save can be set to 'TRUE' if you want to save the current Trello object for 
#later comparison
trello_object[[4]]
```

Viewing a sample of one of the board's cards, you can see that six different 
pieces of information are presented: the name of the card, the card ID, the date
of last modification, the Trello list the card is on, and the items and their
respective status on a card checklist.  If no list is present, the only item
will be "No checklist for this project.

```{r}
trello_object[[2]]
```

# Comparing two Trello objects

One of the main goals of this package is to compare the Trello board at two
different time points to check for changes made to the checklists.  The
trello_updates function can locate any new tasks or status changes made to the 
Trello cards, and can also determine if any new cards have been added since the 
last saved object.

```{r}
report <- trello_updates("Repello - R Reports from Trello", prior="old_object.rds", save=FALSE)
#Note: If 'prior' is not specified, the function will automatically find the most recent saved 
#Trello object to compare to the current rendition.  The function can also accept a 'recent' 
#argument if you want to compare two lists from different time points.

report[[4]]
```

If a card appears on the newest Trello object, but was absent from the prior 
rendition, it will be marked as a new card and all checklist items will be 
considered new items.

```{r}
report[[5]]
```

Some cards do not have checklists.  If this happens, repello will leave the
list_diff element empty for the card.

```{r}
report[[2]]
```

# Creating a Trello Report

The following code is used to create a kable-formatted report of the tasks and 
status of items for each checklist on a recent Trello object compared to a 
prior Trello list from the same board.  The functions used above are utilized here.

```{r, results='asis'}
set_token("user_token.txt")
report <- trello_updates("Repello - R Reports from Trello", prior="old_object.rds", save=FALSE)


new_sticker <- "<div class='sticker'>NEW</div>"
new_headersticker <- "<div class='header-sticker'>NEW</div>"
checkmark <- "<span class='checkmark'><div class='checkmark_stem'></div><div class='checkmark_kick'></div></span>"

for (i in 1:length(report)){
  if (report[[i]]$contains_list=="List Available" & ("New Item" %in% (report[[i]]$list_diff)$history | "Newly Completed" %in% (report[[i]]$list_diff)$status)){
    if (report[[i]]$card_status=="New Card"){
      cat("<h2>", new_headersticker, report[[i]]$name, "</h2>", sep = " ")
    } else {
      cat("## ", report[[i]]$name, "\n\n")
    }
    temp <- report[[i]]$list_diff %>% filter(history=="New Item" | status=="Newly Completed")
    for (j in 1:nrow(temp)){
      if (temp$history[j]=="New Item"){
        temp$item[j] <- paste0(new_sticker, temp$item[j])
      }
    }
    for (k in 1:nrow(temp)){
      if (temp$status[k]=="Newly Completed"){
        temp$complete[k] <- checkmark
      } else {
        temp$complete[k] <- " "
      }
    }
    temp <- temp %>% select(complete, item)
    colnames(temp) <- c("", "Item")
    temp %>% kable(escape=F, align="cl") %>% trimws %>% kable_styling(c("striped","bordered")) %>% column_spec(1, "30px") %>% cat
    cat("  \n")
  }
}
```
